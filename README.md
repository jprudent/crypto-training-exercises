# Exercises for cryptography training

Based on the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) libraries for finite field and elliptic curve operations.

To get your hands on the first exercises about finite fields and elliptic curves:

```console
cd ec-ff
cargo run --release
```

Go through the *scr/main.rs* file to see instructions and solve the questions!
